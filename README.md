# Stochactic_aggregation
Kinetic Monte Carlo model for amyloid aggregtaion is presented. The model includes aggregation of kinetically favored off pathway oligomers and thermodynamically stable on pathway fibrils with secondary nucleation.

Necessary on/off aggregation rates are taken from the article "Mechanism of Fibril and Soluble Oligomer Formation in Amyloid Beta and Hen Egg White Lysozyme Proteins". Carlos Perez, Tatiana Miti, Filip Hasecke, Georg Meisl, Wolfgang Hoyer, Martin Muschol, and Ghanim Ullah. The Journal of Physical Chemistry B 2019 123 (27), 5678-5689,DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b02338

Necessary diffusion rates are taken from the article "Hydration and Hydrodynamic Interactions of Lysozyme: Effects of Chaotropic versus Kosmotropic Ions", Avanish S. Parmar, Martin Muschol,Biophys. Journal 97 (2), DOI:10.1016/j.bpj.2009.04.045
